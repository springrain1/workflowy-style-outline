## v2.8

### ✨ New Features

#### Daily Notes Plus Aggregated Outline View
- **Brand new Daily Notes aggregated view**: Display and edit multiple Daily Notes in a single unified view
- **Three note source modes**:
  - Daily Notes mode: Automatically reads Obsidian core Daily Notes plugin configuration
  - Folder mode: Select any folder to aggregate notes
  - Tag mode: Filter notes by tags
- **Flexible filtering and sorting**:
  - Sorting: date (ascending/descending), creation time, modification time, file name
  - Time ranges: this week/month/year, last week/month/year, this/last quarter, custom range
  - Presets: save and quickly switch between common configurations
- **Efficient editing experience**:
  - Each Daily Note as independent section with collapse/expand
  - Click title to open as standalone outline view
  - Zoom navigation: click bullet to focus on child content with breadcrumb navigation
  - Full outline editing features: indent, move, collapse, delete, multi-select, etc.
  - Cross-section block dragging (normal drag to move, Alt+drag for block references)
  - All editor shortcuts supported (Tab/Enter/Ctrl+Z, etc.)
- **Performance optimization**:
  - On-demand loading: configurable initial batch size, dynamic mount/unmount on scroll
  - Delayed unloading: prevent frequent re-renders when scrolling quickly
- **Convenient features**:
  - Auto-create today's note: toolbar button + optional startup creation
  - Date picker: quickly jump to specific date's Daily Note
  - Fallback configuration: plugin-level settings when core plugin unavailable (folder, date format, template)
  - Theme switching: supports all built-in themes, consistent with standalone view
  - Responsive design: perfect for desktop and mobile

#### Enhanced Link Navigation
- Unified Workflowy link navigation system:
  - Internal links `[[note]]`: open in current view or split pane
  - Heading links `[[note#heading]]`: scroll and highlight target heading
  - Block references `[[note#^blockid]]`: precise navigation to target block
  - Embed link jump button: click to open source file
- Ctrl+Alt+click or Shift+click to open in split pane
- Link navigation in Daily Notes aggregated view:
  - File in aggregation scope: auto-expand corresponding section and navigate
  - File outside scope: open standalone view in new tab
- Jump highlight effect: target content flashes yellow background for 2 seconds, fading out

#### Cross-Document Drag Optimizations
- Alt+drag block reference creation workflow optimized:
  - Same-document source mode: fast path avoiding file events
  - Cross-document or Live Preview: async source block ID update, wait for metadata
  - Auto-generates Obsidian-compliant block IDs (^block-id format)
  - Updates target position block reference after completion
- Cross-section multi-select drag support:
  - Detects multi-select drag data format (`workflowy-multi-blocks`)
  - Supports batch block movement across Daily Notes sections
  - Preserves original drop zone logic (before/after/child)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed multi-select drag compatibility in cross-section scenarios
- Fixed potential data loss risk when saving before file fully loaded
- Fixed editor container loss in certain scenarios
- Fixed subpath navigation event payload parsing compatibility

### 🔧 Improvements
- Deep settings merge: compatible with missing nested config fields from old versions
- Editor container caching: avoid repeated DOM queries, improve rendering performance
- Cross-document event optimization: explicit event payload structure, supports targetLeaf specification
- Debug logging system: enable detailed logs via `settings.isolation.debugMode`
- Unified commands: Daily Notes view and standalone view share editing commands (indent, move, collapse, etc.)

### 📝 License System
- Daily Notes Plus features require license (7-day trial)
- License management UI: enter license key, view status, appreciation/WeChat QR codes
- Trial period displays remaining days
- Expiration prompt for license renewal

## v2.7

### ✨ New Features

#### Table Rendering Enhancements
- Full Markdown table support in Live Preview mode:
  - Table borders, header background, zebra striping
  - Text alignment within tables (left/center/right)
  - Row hover highlighting
- Table styles for all themes (14 built-in themes)
- Table line break logic optimized: table rows connected with single newline to prevent parsing errors

---
### ✨ New Features
- Support for table rendering in nodes

### ✨ New Features

#### Mobile Dual-Mode Toolbar
- Edit toolbar shown when keyboard is up (horizontally scrollable), auto-switches to function toolbar when keyboard is down
- Edit toolbar additions: undo/redo, insert internal link `[[]]`, embed content `![[]]`, add tag `#`, insert attachment (opens system file picker), insert link `[]()`
- Function toolbar: toggle render mode, expand all, collapse all, expand to level (1/2/3)
- Swipe protection: finger movement over 8px threshold treated as scroll, not button tap
- Keyboard dismiss button pinned to the right side of edit toolbar

#### Mobile IME Flicker Fix (MobileDOMPatcher)
- New `MobileDOMPatcher` for precise local DOM updates, avoiding full re-render keyboard flicker
- Toolbar indent/outdent, new block, toggle todo all use local update path
- Physical keyboard Enter/Backspace on mobile use local DOM update path
- Live Preview blur deferred to prevent IME collapse during toolbar operations
- Editing textarea always reused on mobile to prevent detach-induced keyboard flicker

#### Mobile UI Improvements
- Content line changed to top alignment (`flex-start`), bullet/checkbox aligns with first line
- Bullet and checkbox `margin-top: 2px` for precise alignment
- New ordered list number top-alignment styles
- Collapse indicator and checkbox `pointerdown` prevents focus loss
- Mobile focus uses `scrollIntoView({ block: 'center' })` for centered display

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed Live Preview Backspace at cursor start not responding
- Fixed mobile checkbox/collapse indicator click causing focus transfer and IME flicker
- Fixed `enterEditMode` re-entry causing duplicate execution
- Fixed `focus()` not properly activating edit mode in Live Preview
- Fixed mobile indent/undo syncing issues that could cause content loss in nodes above
- Fixed cursor jumping during high-frequency edits and memory leaks from orphaned DOM nodes

### 🔧 Improvements

#### Undo/Redo Architecture Refactor
- Refactored to a Transaction-based undo history system, supporting atomic undo/redo of multi-step and batch operations (e.g., drag & drop, multi-indent)
- Introduced a 3-tier DOM sync strategy (Content-only fast-path → Mobile incremental patch → Full render fallback) to maximize performance while minimizing keyboard flicker on mobile

#### File Saving & Concurrency Control
- Introduced `saveQueue` and debounced task IDs to enforce linear write ordering, preventing race conditions and file corruption during rapid keystrokes or batch alterations
- Upgraded `saveAllEditingContent` strategy to synchronize directly with `OutlineItem` instances rather than relying on DOM queries, enhancing robustness during cross-view deletions and updates

#### MobileDOMPatcher Improvements
- `MobileDOMPatcher` now properly synchronizes Ordered List indices immediately when inserting new nodes, preventing sequence mismatch
- Utilizes strict structural tree matching to prevent context loss during complex edge cases (e.g. outdenting the last node, merging across levels)

## v2.4

### ✨ New Features

#### UI & Interaction Enhancements
- Added new settings options (font size, line height, bullet alignment, font family, etc.)
- Support `Ctrl+Scroll` to quickly adjust font size (10-30px)
- Bullet size automatically adjusts with font size
- Bullet vertical center always aligns with the first line of text
- Font size changes in Live Preview mode keep the render layer consistent with the edit layer
- Collapse indicator changed to SVG implementation

#### Thino Compatibility Mode
- Added Thino/Memos plugin compatibility mode
- **When Thino mode is enabled**:
  - Level 1 list items preserve original continuation line indentation (Tab or Space)
  - Level 2+ list items maintain standard two-space format
  - Original indentation preserved when switching between Markdown ↔ Outline view
  - Optional auto-timestamp for new blocks (`HH:mm` or `HH:mm:ss` format)
  - New command: `Workflowy: Toggle auto-timestamp for new blocks`
- **When Thino mode is disabled**:
  - Tab automatically converted to spaces, continuation lines use two-space format

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed ordered/unordered list rendering in Live Preview mode for single-node continuation content
- Fixed whitespace trimming at both ends of continuation content
- Fixed Thino compatibility toggle not taking effect
- Fixed regex incorrectly identifying lines starting with numbers as list items

### 🔧 Improvements

#### Plugin Compatibility
- Optimized compatibility with Thino and TickTickSync plugins
- Improved continuation line indentation detection and restoration

#### Memory Management
- Added component destruction mechanism to prevent memory leaks
- Added `destroy()` method to `ZoomManager`, `ThemeManager`, `FileDropHandler`
- Enhanced resource cleanup for `TagSuggestMenu`, `SlashCommandMenu`
- Added `OutlineItem.cleanupStaticResources()` static method for drag-related cleanup

#### Lifecycle Management
- Enhanced `WorkflowyView.onClose()` for cascading child component destruction
- Added `isClosing` flag to prevent async operations after view close
- Added `wheelHandler` event tracking for proper event listener removal

#### Defensive Programming
- Added `isDestroyed` checks to `VerticalLinesManager`, `MultiSelectionManager`
- Check component state after async operations to avoid updating destroyed views
- Enhanced plugin `onunload()` to clean up static resources
